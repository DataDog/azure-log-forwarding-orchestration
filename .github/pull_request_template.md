Jira issue:

This change affects:
 - [ ] Control Plane Tasks
 - [ ] Forwarder
 - [ ] ARM Templates (Bicep)

 - [ ] CI/Documentation

## Testing
<!--
How was this tested?
- Unit tests: Test should cover core behavior as well as edge cases.
- Manual testing: Screenshots/logs of real executions in the portal.
-->

## Rollout
<!--
We are now in Beta, customers are not expected to reinstall. Is this PR backwards compatible? If not, how will we handle the rollout?

A good way to test this is by freshly installing LFO, and then deploying your change to the personal environment.

If you are making ARM/bicep changes, ensure that re-deploying the arm template from a fresh install works as expected.
There should be no conflicts or other errors when re-deploying.

 - [ ] I have verified that this change is backwards compatible.
